As well, a lot of names that I would typically ascribe to a certain gender, are marked as another. For instance the names \"Kylie\", \"Daniela\", \"Leah\", or \"Fatima\" are reported as male. While this could very well be true, and names do not need to ascribe to the gender most stereotypically associated with them. It could be worth noting in regards to how the data were collected, and if it is true. Other than, I don't see any serious concerns with the data file."

In order to figure this out, I would likely have to tidy and wrangle the data by so it can be used for an appropriate predictive method. I would select only the Age, played_hours, and subsribe columns. This specific data could help highlight if there are certain characteristics or behaviours to whether a player is subscribing or not. I would create scale and center the data, create a model specification, recipe, workflow. Then I could create a knn nearest classification in order to predict if a player is subscribed based on their age, and amount of hours played. "

    "I think that the data in the players.csv data frame is tidy already, and I do not think it needs minimal tidying or wrangling. It fits the criteria of having each row as being a single observation, each column being a single variable, and each cell holding only one value. If I were to do further wrangling, I could transform the \"Age\" variable into integer type rather than dbl, as none of the values have decimals. I could also transform \"experiece\" and \"gender\" into factors rather than characters."
